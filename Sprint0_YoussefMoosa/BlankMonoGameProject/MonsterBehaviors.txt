$Monster Behaviors$

Key: Block = 16x16 block, they are well defined visually in dungeon. Each room has 12 x 7 of these blocks that can be walked on

Stalfos(skeleton)
	--2 hits from link sword. Deal half a heart to link

	--if carrying a key the key will be 'embedded in the stalfos' basically stalfos sprite is overlayed onto 
		a key sprite or vice versa (hard to tell) and they move as one

	--all share the same behavior though not in unison

	--Do not move to a random position. Instead they seem to change direction to an open block at random time intervals
		though these random intervals seem to be constrained to about 3 intervals of 2,3,4 seconds or more plausible
		is they change direction after they have traversed a certain amount of blocks and each time they turn this amount
		is changed.

		**open block refers to blocks link can also move to with the exception of the door block link appears in when entering
		a room

		**running into a wall did not seem to affect their pathing sequence. So it was more like 'if wall, turn to open block'
		and that was it. Their turning behavior was not affected, they would sometimes turn right after turning away from a wall
		or corner and other times walk most of the way across the screen.

		**would probably be easiest to set a certain amount of blocks or pixels for the stalfos to traverse before changing direction

		**overall movement should be random but consistently random enough that a player could get used to it and feel like they could predict it

	--is not uncommon to become 'stuck' in a corner, that is they would often turn into corners then turn soon after into a wall

	--when hit by link seem to be pushed back about 5 blocks

Keese(bats)
	--take 1 hit from sword, deal half heart of damage

	--have a start up animation of sorts. Start in an idle or sleeping state (idle is open wings, sleep is folded wings)
		as the keese starts moving it's animation will speed up to go from slow flapping to fast flapping

	--seem to have similar move set to stalfo in that they change their direction after traversing so many tiles or after
		some amount of time, hard to tell which. Different though is they can move diaganolly.

	--in adition to speeding up and slowing down animation when they are in their slowest moving state but not idle they move slower
		than the stalfo but when they reach max animation speed they move faster and change direction more often, not uncommon to
		see one fly in a circle or make a hook/half oval turn via multiple diagonal turns with a seperation of about 1.5 blocks between
		each turn

	--unlike stalfo they occasionally go into a sleep/idle state, usually every 6-12 seconds (roughly)

	--can move over blocked blocks (so the obstacle ones that link and stalfo are stopped at)

	--no pushback cause die in 1 hit

Goriya(boomerang panda bois)
	--deal half heart of damage (? maybe need check?), take 3 hits to kill

	--same movement as stalfo

	--unlike stalfo has boomerang attack, will throw boomerang semi often. So about as often as the keese stop for a nap

$Item behavior$

all seem to be picked up soon as link touches one of the pixels

Keys
	--do not despawn
Rupees
	--despawn after about 8 seconds

$Pushback behavior$

This is the behavior displayed by all enemies & link when they are damaged, so far confirmed on goriyas and stalfos
Will stop at a wall, or if link when he hits another enemy

Monsters
	--If monster is not killed it is pushed back about 5 blocks from any damage and has a damage coloring animation

Link
	--Pushed back about 3 blocks when damaged by enemies
