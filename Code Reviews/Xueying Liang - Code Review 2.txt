Focus: Readability
Time to review: 20 minutes

This class in general is readable and easy to understand. The use of Dictionary which links a string and a <br />
room together is also very useful which makes the code easier to read and understand. Also helps the debug process <br />
go smoother. This is as far as consistency. <br />

As well as accidental errors and structural errors, there are none in this class. The performance of writing a <br />
RoomFactory class to handle mainly creating room, loading room and reseting rooms is a useful way. So that all the <br />
logic and lines of code would have their own space to be handles instead of intertwining with other jobs.
