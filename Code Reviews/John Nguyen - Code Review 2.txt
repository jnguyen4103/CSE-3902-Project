Overall the code is well written and has clear variable and method names that makes it easy to read and follow. Grant did a good job
separating out all of Aquamentus' behavior so it's easy to track what each method call would correspond to how Aquamentus behaves. As I'm 
reading through the code, I can envision what Aquamentus is doing with each method call and even though there are few comments, I can understand
what this class is supposed to be doing.

Right now there are some weird behaviors that Aquamentus is experiencing but it's in line with a known bug that we have and are trying to work
on. Aquamentus can clip through walls when he gets hurt but I don't believe that it has anything to do with how this class is written.
