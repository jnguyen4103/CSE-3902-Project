The Collision Handler being a static class is a great idea since all of its methods change their formal parameters
and nothing needs to be stored in the class.

Every method name has a descriptive name and the formal parameter names give enough information to know what is
occuring.

The spacing is good easily readable, the separate between public and private methods is nice when you need to call a public
method outside and need to briefly glance in the file.
