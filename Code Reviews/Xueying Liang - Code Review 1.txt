Sprint Number #3\
Author of the code review: Xueying Liang\
File being reviewed: IRoom.cs\
Author of file: Youssef Moosa\
Date of the code review: 3/6/2020\
Focus: Maintainability\
Time to review: 15 minutes\
\
This interface is a pretty good example which has relatively smaller size, and 4 methods that later all the rooms will base on. In terms of complexity, it is not complex and can be easily understand. The consistency and structure are also very useful and concise for later sprints. There are no stylistic warnings as of this interface at all which proofs that there\'92s not much improvement we can do on it. \
\
A hypothetical change I would make to this class is that: I might added another method related to door for each room. For example, something like void OpenDoor() that only opens locked door, and void WalkThrough() that only walks through opened door. But door opening is handled somewhere else in our project and if I want to make this change to IRoom interface, I have to override some other things as well.\cell
