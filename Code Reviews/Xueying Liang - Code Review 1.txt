This is very maintainable, unique and useful way for scrolling in between the rooms.
With short methods like Update(), Transition() and Set Position(), this file does not need much reactor later on and can be reused easily. I wrote a lot of XML files and the idea of camera came before we did any XML files so that it really helped with the process of viewing the dungeon as a whole.
