This interface is a pretty good example which has relatively smaller size, and 4 methods that later all the rooms will <br />
base on. In terms of complexity, it is not complex and can be easily understand. The consistency and structure are also <br />
very useful and concise for later sprints. There are no stylistic warnings as of this interface at all which proofs <br />
that there’s not much improvement we can do on it. <br />

A hypothetical change I would make to this class is that: I might added another method related to door for each room. <br />
For example, something like void OpenDoor() that only opens locked door, and void WalkThrough() that only walks <br />
through opened door. But door opening is handled somewhere else in our project and if I want to make this change <br />
to IRoom interface, I have to override some other things as well.
