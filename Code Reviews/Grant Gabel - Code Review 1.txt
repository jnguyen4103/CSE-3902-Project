Focus: Maintainability
Time to review: 10 minutes

While the command on it's own is quite maintainable due to the minimilistic nature, because the fuctionality is spread far and
wide throughout the whole game - with pause functionality appearing in the Update() method in the main game file as well as
in the keyboard controller even though neither of these are referenced in the pause command. I believe this code is not very maintainable.
One would have to track down every mention of the word pause in all the game files and figure out if they needed to change it if they
wanted to change the nature of pause in any way. 

I would like to see at least comments on where else / what else pause is affecting. Ideally I would love to see it so all the pause
functionality is handled inside the command - calls and all (even if the calls are something like "monsters.pause()" or "link.pause()".
But this would require a huge rework of the code as a whole and is probably not a good use of time at this point in the project.
