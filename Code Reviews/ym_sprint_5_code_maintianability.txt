Name of .cs file:             IGameState.cs

Specific Comments:

* This is a really nice interface, especially
  because GameState is such a big thing, and
  its members can be called mini-programs in their own right.

* The interface looks simple to use and fits well into MonoGame.

* Properies in interfaces are a bit awkward, as properties act
  a lot like instance variables in those cases.

Specific fixes:

* There are a couple ways to remove the property and attain
  equivalent functionality. One is to make isTransitioning
  a function instead, and have a private boolean determine
  the result. Another way is to have transition states instead
  of a bool to determine transitions. Both ways are fine, though
  I prefer the former since it involves less boilerplate.
