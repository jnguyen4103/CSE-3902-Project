Time to review: 15 minutes

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

* 1. Commenting and documentation makes a file more readable. 
There is no Documentation or comments presented in the file and if we want to improve 
it's readability, we can consider writing up some documentations and comments for methods.
But this file is readable in general. With the descriptive method names, we can easily understand 
that this class is switching between dungeons and also changing their sound corresponding to
different dungeons. When I saw the changes in the game, I was imagine more complicated code 
that does the same job. I feel pretty impressed that this file is highly readable.

* 2. Consistent indentation makes a file more readable. 
And in this file all methods does have consistent indentation which helps improve readability.
It is another factor that makes the file readable. 

* 3. Code grouping makes a file more readable. 
There's not much code grouping to do in this file. Rather they are grouped by different method.
Which in my opinion is even better in terms of readability.

* 4. Consistent naming scheme makes a file more readable. 
There's not much variables to have names, because mostly is just to assign the variables from
main game class to different things in order to perform in another dungon or to switch songs
as Link is entering different dungeon.

* 5. Avoid deep nesting makes a file more readable. 
In this file there is no sign of deep nesting and it is readable from this point of view.
