Focus: Readability
Time to review: 35 minutes

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

* 1. Commenting and documentation makes a file more readable. 
There are some comments there for some methods, but comments should be more clear on what specific
method is doing. It is hard to describe it so I will left an example for it. In the method PicupItem(),
the comment says "Cannot PickupItem", I think it is a little confusing and might need to explain why 
items can not be picked up. There is no Documentation presented in the file and if we want to improve 
it's readability, we can consider writing up some documentations for methods.

* 2. Consistent indentation makes a file more readable. 
And in this file all methods does have consistent indentation which helps improve readability.
It is another factor that makes the file readable. 

* 3. Code grouping makes a file more readable. 
I noticed in this file public variables and private variables are grouped separately(mostly). But 
"YOUWON" and "TriForcePepe" are two private variables that were grouped together with the public
variables which is not as readable. 

* 4. Consistent naming scheme makes a file more readable. 
All method names follow the naming convention of using "PascalCase" makes this file readable.

* 5. Avoid deep nesting makes a file more readable. 
In this file there is no sign of deep nesting and it is readable from this point of view.
