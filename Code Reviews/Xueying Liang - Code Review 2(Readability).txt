Author of the code review: Xueying Liang
File being reviewed: PickupLink.cs
Author of file: Nico Negrete
Date of the code review: 4/13/2020
Focus: Readability
Time to review: 30 minutes

Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

* 1. Commenting and Documentation makes a file more readable. 
There are some comments there for some methods, but comments should be more clear on what specific
method is doing. There is no Documentation presented in the file and if we want to improve it's 
readability, we can consider writing up some documentations for methods.

* 2. Consistent Indentation makes a file more readable. 
And in this file all methods does have consistent indentation which helps improve readability.

* The logic is also pretty straight forward, constraints, preconditions and its contextual information
is easy to understand. DeadLink.cs basically resets the whole game if a player is dead. And it is listed 
in the method called DeadLink().

* On another note, there are a lot more methods that are not necessarily in use and the method body is
empty seems redundent and not as efficient. We should consider reviewing and revising soon to make this
file shorter and more effective.
