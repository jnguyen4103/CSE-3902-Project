Time to review: 15 minutes

This class in general is readable and easy to understand. It is also very useful which makes the code easier to read and understand. Also helps the debug process <br />
go smoother. This is as far as consistency. <br />
Stephen has refactored this code so that it now just update different variables in a clear and readable way.


As well as accidental errors and structural errors, there are none in this class. The performance of writing a reset command which extends from ICommand and rewrite some of its method is very useful and readable.
