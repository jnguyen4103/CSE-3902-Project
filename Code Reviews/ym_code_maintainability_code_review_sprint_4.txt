Specific Comments on Code Quality:

* Selection menu is a very specific thing which has a very
  specific implementation that isn't very polymorphic.
  Even if it were, it'd be better to switch to a new
  menu context, so to speak. Making an interface for it 
  adds indirection where it's not needed, which adds more 
  boilerplate code that hurts rather than helps.

  ** To change this means to drop the interface, and
     have the commands related to it take the SelectionMenu
     instead of ISelectionMenu.

* The keyboard controller has gotten ugly enough to warrant the
  fact that it might be better to leave keyboard controller to
  update the game, but have a separate update mechanism in
  the selection menu which takes action based on input solely
  int there.

  ** Yes, that means if we change the input scheme for the
     game, we have to change it for here, too. However, I still
     think it'd be less complicated to do even that, nonetheless.

* A lot of things seem to depend on Game1. It's a shame
  that so many classes, including this one, have their
  grimy hands on it. I understand it was an early design
  happenstance that's too late to change now, but for the
  sake of noting disadvantageous circumstances, that's one of them.

  ** I have no easy way to change this.
