I think this class is very readable and very well done. I know nico had stressed to the group recently about how important self commenting
code was / is, and I think this class is a great example of that. Just from the names of everything I can tell what that variable or 
method does. Only exception being the Reset() method, but it's just that it's the method / variable with the name that's the least 
descriptive I think. Everything else I can read and know almost immediately what it does, but this one I need to read the method in order
to fully understand what it's doing. Once I read the method I could better understand it. I don't think there's really a better name, 
this is just nitpicking in order to provide feedback.

The only other criticism I can think of is that there are a few magic numbers that could use variable names, but ther'es only a few 
instances of it and it seems to be heavily related to the math in calculating the pathing so it's probably not the easiest thing to come 
up with variable names for. The ones that stick out the most are the numbers used in comparison for the Math.abs calls on lines 81 and 252. 
So I think since it's only two cases of it, it's not as much of a problem as it is in other classes in our project where magic numbers are
rampant.
