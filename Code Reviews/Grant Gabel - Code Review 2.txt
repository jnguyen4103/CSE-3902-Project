I would have liked to see this functionality put into it's own class or file instead of added as another method in the main Game1.cs file
but I can understand if this was the best way as gamesound is important and should be on the same level as the drawing of object.

I like how the code is self documenting in that just by reading the variable names and calls I can understand what the code is doing. 

It does feel a bit scattered - which is to say I have to hunt a little bit for all the pieces but this is to be expected for something on 
the same level as Draw() so I don't think it's an actual problem.
