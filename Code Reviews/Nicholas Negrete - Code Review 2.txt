Time to review: 10 minutes

Specific Comments: 
Some of the variable names seem to be inconsistent with the writing style, some variables seem to start with uppercase letters while others just seem to start off with lower case, sort of a small thing but I beileve it is noticeable and can lead to small annoying complicatiosn later on. Things that need to be together are seperated by two new lines I think this makes it easier to read. Some of the if statements seem to have more new lines that necessary maybe get rid of some of those, and unnecessary comments, the code should be documenting itself with the variable names. Also I feel as though we can combine some of the StaticSprites together and deal with say a list of weapons rather than WeaponA and WeaponB.
