Focus: Readability
Time to review: 10 minutes

Specific Comments: 
Everything seems to be readable the variable names are all self documenting, and the logic in the class is not hard to follow, 
and everything in the class makes sense on why you would have it. Naming convention was uniform as well as having the code itself spaced 
in an organic way. Comments were nice but shouldn't be necessary because of the set up of the file. (The way vairables were named and how theyd what was happening in a method)
