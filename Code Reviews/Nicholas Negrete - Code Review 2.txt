Specific Comments: 
So overall the structure of the class is very good. the keyboard commands are done in the controller and not in the game class so thats great. Some things though about the readability, some of the variable names are not very descriptive like m, whats m I understand that its in a foreach loop so its almost like ofcourse its a monster but its still something to try and be more observant of. The comments while they are nice to see what you are doing in plain english but shouldn't be necessary the code should be describing itself with the variable names and we shouldn't need these comments. Some of the if statments are just {code} and i personally find this harder to read but thats just me. Spacing seems consistent. Other than these smaller things everything looks great! thank you!
