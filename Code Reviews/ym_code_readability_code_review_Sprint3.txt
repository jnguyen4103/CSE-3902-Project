Specific Comments on Readability:

I think everything is readable, for the most part.
However, there are things which could improve readability.

* Notice when direction is being referenced, the underlying
  data changes are usually follows a certain pattern which
  could be generalized using the Math.Sin and Math.Cos functions
  (i.e. Up = (Cos(PI/2), Sin(PI/2)), Left = (Cos(PI), Sin(PI)), etc.)
  so instead of having an MonsterDirection, a Vector2 would be preferred
  so that the switch-case statement turns into something like
  
  self.Sprite.CurrentSpeed.X *= Direction.X, self.Sprite.CurrentSpeed.X *= Direction.Y

  where Direction = (Cos(PI * random(0,4) / 4), Sin(PI * random(0,4) / 4))

  or some similar statement which takes up a few lines and has little decision-making to do.  
  
  ** I do know that the IStateMachine class itself relies on the enumeration
     of direction and some switch-case statements, so this change would
     be harder to implement.

* Switching from using integer timers to float timers which count in seconds rather
  than in frames would give a greater intuition on how much time something takes,
  hence making it a little more readable. Would also remove the need for this
  FPS variable which is confusing to someone who hasn't been exposed to the code before.

  ** I know the FPS variable was in IStateMachine, which wasn't Grant's responsibility.
