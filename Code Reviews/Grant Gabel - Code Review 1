Nice and short concrete class, very good readability. I like how white space is managed, makes my eyes happy. Even though I didn't know / 
think about needing an IsCreator method the naming convention and parameters make it easy for me to tell at a glance what the method does
and what it would be used for. 

I would like to see comments in the constructor mentioning why damage is initialized to zero, seems odd to me. especially since there are
comments in the CreateEffect() method which are helpful but don't seem as necessary to me as explaining why certain values are initialized 
to the values they are initialized to (like damage = 0).
