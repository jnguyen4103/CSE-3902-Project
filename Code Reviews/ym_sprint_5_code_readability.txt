Specific Comments:

* Good variable names.

* I actually think that in the if statement,
  it'd be more readable if you put "DoorHitbox.X + DoorHitbox.Width"
  instead of allocating a new local variable endHitboxX, even though
  it's more verbose. That's just a picky point, though, and doesn't
  interfere much with readability.

* I notice that Game.CurrDungeon.ActiveRoom.RoomTransitions is used once,
  but that Game.CurrDungeon.ActiveRoom is used multiple times. Consider
  making that a local variable instead of screenTransitions.
