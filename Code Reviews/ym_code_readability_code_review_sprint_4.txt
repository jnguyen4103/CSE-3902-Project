Comments on readability:

* There's a bunch of using directives above which
  aren't being used.

  ** This is understandable, as Visual Studio likes
     to put a lot of boilerplate by default. This
     also very minorly affects readability, of course.

* It's a very compact class which is clear to understand 
  from a functionality standpoint.

* There's a lot of redirection with Game1 Game, where I
  have to look at Game, then I have to look at camera
  and what contexts that's in, and then its transition
  function to get the whole picture.

  ** I know this is out of necessity, and it's not worth
     the effort to change this point to make it more readable.
     Still something I'd like to mention for the readability
     review to be more verbose.
