Specific Comments: 
Very good. There arent many issues that are screaming out to me. It does seem thought that it is too good if that makes sense. When  inspecting your code, yes it is very simple but alot is really going on. Why is it better to have this Update the game rather thant the actual game it seems as though we are making more work but we are actually not. The GameState should be in charge of these things so great job all in all! 
The only thing that is screaming to me is why does an interface have a field like that? Aren't they only supposed to have method declarations, if you want a field like that maybe make an abstract class instead.
