I chose this specific file for my maintainability review since I actually had to maintain the code and add
new code to it.

Firstly, the switch statement that cycles through each node name makes it really easy to write XML and add
a case statement for any object you're trying to create via XML.

The addition of private methods at the bottom that convert strings to various objects needed to create
an object is a nice addition since it's reusable and easy to add more methods for other datatypes.

My main concern about the Reader is if we have objects that don't need a specific spawn point, so if we were to
give a room a shader and use the XML to create the shader, what would be an easy way to do that instead of
creating multiple tags. This could be with my unfamiliary with XML, or just the limitation of other sections
of our code showing through.

Overall, the code is easy to understand and add changes that wouldn't have cascading effects and cause issues down the line.
