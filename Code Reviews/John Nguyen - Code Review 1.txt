Overall, the Item class is kept simple which has made it easy to use and expand when more functionality is needed, like picking up and item 
and making it disappear form the game window. The code is readable and even without comments, a glance at it lets the reader know what this 
class is supposed to be doing. This makes the code more maintainable for us in the future.

My concern with this is that this class knows about the game class which means that it knows about pretty much everything else. This makes 
coupling for this class really tight and might come back and bite us later. A suggestion I have if we ever refactor this class is to make it
only know about Link since he is the primary user of items. I will look further into this and see if there is an easy way we can implement that
given all the work we have done so far.
