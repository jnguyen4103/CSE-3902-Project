Sprint Number #5
Author of the code review: Xueying Liang
File being reviewed: Inventory.cs
Author of file: Grant Gabel Gabel
Date of the code review: 4/23/2020
Focus: Maintainability(Code quality)
Time to review: 25 minutes

Specific comments on code quality:

* In terms of code quality, this file is efficient. It achieved maintainability by code organization
and adequate comments. Grant updated this file from previous Sprint based on HUD.cs in order to update 
inventory screen funcionality. With the structure of this file, it seems that this file is long, but it 
is easy to understand and reuse it when needed. (For item selection menu functionality, I would think that
it can be added on top of Inventory.cs)

* There are several methods, for example: UpdateInventoryCounters(), UpdateRupeeCounter(), UpdateBombCounter(),
UpdateKeyCounter(), etc. All methods are seperate of each other that only does one thing at a time. All methods
also have descriptive names. If we want to update or reuse one specific funcionality later, then we can edit that 
particular method related to the functionality we are using. 

* The logic is also pretty straight forward, constraints, preconditions and its contextual information
is easy to understand. 
  
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current 
implementation could or could not easily support that change:

* One hypotherical change I can think of is in method Draw(), more than one thing is being taken care of (Item Draw
and Update, Health Draw and Update, Inventory Map and Update ), I would edit this method so that only one thing is 
being taken care of at a time. The current implementation would support this easily. Since this class already had 
a lot of methods.
