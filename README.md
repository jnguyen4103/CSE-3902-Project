Sprint 03 README
Team Ocarina
This is a group project completed for CSE 3902 project course, during the process, each sprite project is making effort towards the complete game. 
Our group members are: Xueying Liang, Nicholas Negrete, Grant Gabel, Youssef Moosa, John Nguyen and Stephen Hogg.

The game has standard WASD movement

Keybindings
The Q key allows you to exit the game
The R key resets the game and places Link in the debug room
Attacks:
1 - Bomb
2 - Arrow
3 - Blue Candle
4 - Boomerang

Additions:
There is no mouse controller since the room transitions are implemented so one can walk from
room to room just by entering the doorway.

The Link sprint was replaced with a Donald Trump sprite who fights with a red lightsaber.
The HUD takes count of the keys, bombs and rupees Link collects as well as his health
and the map. Not all of the HUD is implemented but some of it to allow use for the pickups.

Custom monsters have been added:
Zol: Explodes on death or when it gets near Link
Lynel: Throws a sword beam at Link or charges him if he gets close
Darknut: Walks to Link's last location and charges Link when he gets close
