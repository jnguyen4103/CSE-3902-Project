### Custom monsters:
Zol: Explodes on death or when it gets near Link<br/>
Lynel: Throws a sword beam at Link or charges him if he gets close<br/>
Darknut: Walks to Link's last location and charges Link when he gets close<br/>

### Additions:
There is no mouse controller since the room transitions are implemented so one can walk from<br/>
room to room just by entering the doorway.<br/>

The Link sprint was replaced with a Donald Trump sprite who fights with a red lightsaber.<br/>
The HUD takes count of the keys, bombs and rupees Link collects as well as his health<br/>
and the map. Not all of the HUD is implemented but some of it to allow use for the pickups.<br/>
