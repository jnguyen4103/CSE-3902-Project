1. Create a branch for the component you’re working on.

2. Clone the branch from our remote repo onto your computer.
Open Git Bash in the folder you want to store the branch to. This will be known as your  local branch.
Use command: git clone --single-branch --branch <branch_name> <repo_url>

3. Code, Test, Rinse, and Repeat.

4. Open Git Bash in the folder that was cloned from the remote repository. This is known as the remote tracking branch.

5. When you’re happy with your code and everything is working, add your changes to the staging area
git add .

6. Commit the changes from the staging area
git commit -m “Comment here”

7. If two people are working on the same branch and there is a change to that branch, it is best practice to pull the new changes to your local repo before pushing your own changes to prevent conflicts. 
git pull <repo_url> <branch_name>

8. When you do the above, you might get some merge conflicts. Set up visual studio as a merge tool in order to resolve these conflicts. 
  8a. If for some reason you decide that you didn't want to pull some changes, you can use the git reflog command to show your commit history   on a local branch.
  8b. After you find the commit address you want (the string of numbers and letters before each commit), use git reset --hard <commit_address> to revert your local changes.

9. Once these conflicts are resolved, you are ready to push the changes to that branch.
git push
