- In the switch statement for randDirection,
  consider having an array of integers of size 4
  and use new Vector2(randDirX[randDirection-1], randDirY[randDirection-1]) * randDistance, 
  where

  randDirX = { 0, 0, -1, 1 }
  randDirY = { -1, 1, 0, 0 }

  This elimates the switch statement and makes the code more readable.

- For GoriyasSM, consider using an enum and switch statements instead of
  separate functions to keep the state-switching code in one centralized place.
