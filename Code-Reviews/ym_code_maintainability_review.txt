Comments:

- Consider making the public instance variables properties instead.
  This can be done easily within the current code by appending { get; set; }
  after the name

(ex) public IEffect[] Secondaries; -> public IEffect[] Secondaries { get; set; }

- Consider cloning the IEffect[] in the constructor instead of assigning the reference.
  This would make it so that Link has his own inventory apart from the starting configuration.
  To do this is also a simple refactoring.

Secondaries = (IEffect[])(_secondaries.Clone());
