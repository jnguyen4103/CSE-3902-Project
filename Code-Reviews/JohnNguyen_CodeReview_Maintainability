Comments:
This class was written very concisely and is cohesive. It does the job that it is supposed to do which is
to handle the Link sprite movements/animations. All the methods within this class are also cohesive and only 
does one "job" which is good because if one method is in charge of too much, it can lead to harder to fix
bugs. One improvement that I can see is within the DrawSprite() method where the size of the sprites are hard coded.
This makes it hard to draw a link attacking for example where the sprite has a different size due to the sword. 
A suggestion is to maybe have a LinkSpriteFactory or make LinkSprite an interface where other different types of Link sprites can stem from.
