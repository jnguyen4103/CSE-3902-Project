	Date of the code review: 2/17/2020
	Sprint number: Sprint #2
	Name of the .cs file being reviewed: LinkWalkUp.cs
	Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Stephen Hogg
	Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 15 minutes
	Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
		Our group did Sprint #2 based on Youssef's Sprint #0 code, Stephen tried to use Command
	interface in a very intelligent way, instead of hard coding it, he refactored the code so 
	that it is easy to understand, does not take too many lines of the code and functioning
	very well. It is overall done very nice.

Code quality review:

	Specific comments on code quality:
		Stephen's code is high quality. He utilized the command interface very well and wrote
	concise and short code. Once again it functions very well and has high quality.
	A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current
	implementation could or could not easily support that change:
		One change that I would considering changing for this file is that to change the file's
	name to "LinkWalkUpCommand" so that it is very easily understand that this is a command class.
	There are not much changes needed in the main game class, just when calling command classes,
	still using their corresponding names and that's the only thing.
