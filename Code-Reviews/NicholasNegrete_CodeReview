Specific Comments: The class overall looks super good, 
					a lot of cohesion everything seems to make sense why you would have it! 
					Some minor things like 
					What is the difference between attackDamage and ContactDamge?
					generateRandomPosition() doesn't seem to be used in this class 
					while it may be inherited from the NPC abstract class maybe just
					throw new NonIMplemented Exception? Or just leave empty like the 
					other methods that aren't implemented.
