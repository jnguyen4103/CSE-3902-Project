Sprint Reflection:
	This sprint served to really point out our weaknesses as a group. With how we started the sprint I think we all share the same goal
	and all want this project to go well and to make a great game, but that almost makes it harder to deal with our problems. I find it
	difficult to think about how to better organize without taking too much of a leadership role or stepping on toes too much or making
	people feel incompetent. 

	Though I don't think I'll have to do that really. I think while a lot of weak points were exposed over the past few weeks we all saw
	the weak points and care enough to try and improve on them. I think going forward we are well aware of our problems and downfalls and 
	I think this could lead to a stronger finished product since we are dealing with our group dynamics early on. At least I'd like to be
	optimistic and hope so.
