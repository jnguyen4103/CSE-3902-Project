This is the reflection wrote by Xueying Liang:

Sprint Reflection:
	Questions that appeared during the process that we are working through this sprint:
		1> When we are planning it, sometimes people were absent and didn't have a complete understanding on
	what we are doing.
		2> We as a whole started the project a little late down the deadline.
		3> When we planned doing the sprint, we did not communicate clearly such that everyone may have a 
	different plan even when thinking of implementing the same thing. 
		4> The dividing up the work in between everyone, a lot of the work were connected somehow. Such that 
	a deadlock of everyone expecting someone else finishing some part of the functionality and then doing it
	dragged too much time. 
		Later on all of us should pay more attention and trying to divide the work evenly and have a smoother
	process.
