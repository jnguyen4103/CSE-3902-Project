Sprint Reflection:
	To start this sprint we had an original idea of how we wanted to design the project such that it would be maintainable and reusable. 
	The team started work later realized that this design would not work right away and that we would also need a to use the State Machine design pattern. 
	The team continued worked a little closer to the due date and this caused the team to have some frustration because certain features weren't implemented right away. 
	This intern caused the team to be slightly more stressed and frantic. Eventually the job got done and the project was submitted, but not without our fair share of headaches. 
	This is because we did not fully flesh out the design and we did not get a proper plan of attack resulting in stressful situation.
	The team also had slight communication errors in the beginning.
	
	In the future we are going to more thoroughly flesh out the design and figure out what exactly each class should do and how they should interact with each other, as well as what properties each class should have. 
	We shall start WAY sooner as to avoid any stressful situation and conflicts that may arise from us starting so late, as well as communicate better at what is going to be done.
