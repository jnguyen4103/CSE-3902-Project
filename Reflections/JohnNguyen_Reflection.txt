Sprint02 Reflection 
Author: John Nguyen

This Sprint revealed a major weakness with our team and that was communication. I will first give credit where credit is due and say that
Stephen Hogg did the majority of the work for Sprint2. This is not to say that every other member on the team was lazy because we had all 
implemented our part but because commits weren't being made to GitHub, there was no way to tell whether or not work was being done. For example
my job was to implement items and the ability to scroll through them and I did exactly that but then later found out that Stephen had
already done it also because I haven't committed to my own branch yet. 

This Sprint also revealed that we must be more organized as a team for future sprints. We have decided that before this next Sprint, we will sit
down and plan out a skeleton for everything that will be required in Sprint3 instead of just assigning "tasks" to people based on the 
Sprint requirement. This will allow everyone to know exactly what to work on and we can hopefully avoid stepping on each other's toes. Stephen
should not be the only one doing work for this class because it is a team effort after all. We're all here to learn and improve as
programmers.
