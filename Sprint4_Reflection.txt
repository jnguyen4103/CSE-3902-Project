Sprint Reflection

Group: Ocarina
Class: 9:10-10:05

The group's performance didn't deviate much from last sprint,
though there has been difficulty getting the last stretch
of the Sprint to work (moreso than last Sprint). 
The burndown chart has been improved though, actually
tapering off at the end, which is how it should normally
go.

There were a number of improvements from last sprint which
were neglected this sprint, unfortunately. One of which is
that we let communication tank terribly. We ran into problems
recovering the same level of communication we had during
the quarantine. One course of action we could take to mitigate
this is to actually establish weekly meetings and to establish
them early. The task board was also there, but the tasks went
kind of slow and had a lack of deadlines. This lead to a lack
of urgency. The best thing to do in light of this is to
go back to having deadlines for certain pieces of functionality.
Hopefully, this should be more easy next Sprint, since we
implement features of our choice, and so the deadline pill
should be easier to swallow.

In the midst of all this, there is one noteable
improvement, overall. Though Stephen did very good work in
the previous sprints, and surely he would've put us in
a better place this sprint, having him off the group allows
the members to share ideas and work together as more of a
team rather than a single person, as well as be able to
share blame when things go wrong, which is both better for
him and for us overall.

As for changes to the sprint which were detrimental, it
wasn't actual, direct changes made especially this sprint
which were detrimental. It was more of negligence to
the changes of last sprint which were detrimental. There
were no other detrimental changes to note.
