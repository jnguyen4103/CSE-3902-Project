Sprint 5 Reflection

Group: Ocarina
Class: 9:10

The group performed better this sprint than
last sprint, though there's still some trouble
getting some pieces to work at the end.

There were notable improvements to our process this
sprint. One of those improvements is that we set
some deadlines for this sprint, which wasn't done
last sprint. We also ended up using the Discord chat more
this sprint than last sprint. Another positive is that
the burndown chart slope is steeper than last sprint,
though a reason for that is because there's less time to
work on this sprint.

As noted above, there were issues with some sections of
the project which still need to be straightened out
(namely, item selection). Communication regarding those
areas would have been helpful in getting that solved,
but that was neglected. Other than that, the finishing
process has been overall smooth.

No changes made in this sprint compared to last sprint
were detrimental to the group.
